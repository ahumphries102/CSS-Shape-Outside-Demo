            <p>Creepy Garfield refers to a series of Garfield-inspired artwork in which Garfield is depicted as a horror creature stalking his owner Jon. Popularized by drawings created by horror artist William Burke in Autumn 2018, the trend continued in a series of videos and similar work from other artists, with Garfield often addressing Jon with such remarks as "I'm sorry, Jon" and "I require lasagna". In 2018, the character was featured in the SCP Foundation as SCP-3166, added by SCP Foundation user Tanhony on February 25th.[2]

On September 12th, 2018, Redditor mnvz posted an original three-panel comic strip in which "Garfold" was reimagined as a horror creature in /r/surrealmemes subreddit.[3] The comic gained over 15,700 upvotes in six months. On September 14th, Redditor idea4granted posted a 3D animation of Garfield bouncing off the floor with the phrase "CONSUME LASAGNA" flashing on the screen, which gained over 12,600 upvotes.[4]</p>
